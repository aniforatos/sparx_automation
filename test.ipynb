      "MS: Components can lose liveliness by having failures that are not network related. They can lose liveliness by having failures that are, as well. Therefore, we should treat liveliness faults independently from the latency faults.&#xD;\n",

      "Additionally, a failed ping test (one where the ICMP echo/reply loop is never closed) is us checking loss of comms another way, instead of relying on liveliness. So, loss of comms could be a combination of liveliness testing and a NaN for the ping latency.</Comment><Type>Note</Type></Row><Row><DiagramName>Monitor Network Infrastructure</DiagramName><ElementName xmlns:dt=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:datatypes\" dt:dt=\"bin.base64\"/><Comment>BT: also derived from FAA122&#xD;\n",
